Category guide:
- order: physical or digital product purchase that ISN'T clothing (Amazon, eBay, Best Buy, Etsy, electronics, home goods, etc.)
- clothes: apparel, footwear, and fashion accessories (Nike, Zara, H&M, Uniqlo, Lululemon, shoes, jackets, a clothing order from any retailer, etc.)
- shipping: a shipping/delivery STATUS update for an order already placed ("your order has shipped", "out for delivery", "delivered", "tracking update", "arriving Tuesday"). This is a notification, NOT a new purchase — omit amount. If a future delivery date is stated, set eventDate to it.
- subscription: recurring service charge (Netflix, Spotify, iCloud, gym, SaaS, etc.)
- travel: flights, hotels, car rentals, rideshare (Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, etc.)
- food: restaurants, food delivery (Uber Eats, DoorDash, Grubhub, etc.)
- entertainment: event tickets, games, streaming one-offs
- charity: donations to nonprofits, charities, crowdfunding (GoFundMe, etc.) — use amount if present
- marketing: promotional newsletters, deals, sales announcements, coupon emails, brand updates — use vendor = the sending brand; omit amount
- refund: a refund, return completed, money back, or credit issued by a merchant ("we've refunded", "your refund is on its way", "return processed", "credit applied"). Set amount = the refunded amount (positive). This is money coming BACK, so it's tracked as negative spend.
- other: any other confirmed purchase or financial notification not covered above

Key rules:
- "marketing" is for bulk/promotional email from businesses (newsletters, flash sales, "we miss you", coupon codes, etc.)
- Real purchase receipts or order confirmations are NEVER marketing — classify them by type (order, clothes, food, etc.)
- A purchase of apparel/footwear/fashion is "clothes", not "order" — even from a general retailer like Amazon (e.g. a t-shirt order → clothes)
- A shipping/delivery/tracking status update is "shipping", NEVER "order". It refers to an order already placed, so counting it as a purchase would double-count one order across its "ordered" / "shipped" / "delivered" emails. Only the ORIGINAL order confirmation or receipt (the one that represents the actual purchase/charge) is "order" (or "clothes"); every later status update for that same order is "shipping".
- A refund / return / money-back / credit email is "refund", NOT "order" — even if it's from a store. Only classify as a purchase when money went OUT.
- Charity thank-you / receipt emails ARE charity, not marketing
- If unsure between marketing and null, pick marketing for any brand promotional email

eventDate / promo rules:
- eventDate is a FUTURE-relevant date pulled from the email text when present: "arriving Jun 5", "departs Aug 12", "check-in Sep 1", "event on Oct 3" → that date. For a marketing/promo email, eventDate is the offer EXPIRY ("ends Sunday", "valid through 6/30"). Resolve relative dates (e.g. "Sunday") against the email Date when you can; otherwise omit. Omit entirely if no such date is stated.
- promoCode + discount apply to marketing/promo emails only: extract the literal code and a short offer description when shown. Omit when not a promo.
- free trials: an email saying a FREE TRIAL is ending / converting to paid ("your free trial ends on …", "trial ends in 3 days", "you'll be charged on …") is category "subscription" with NO amount yet, eventDate = the date the trial ends / first charge hits, vendor = the service, and description noting "free trial ends".

termMonths rule:
- Set termMonths ONLY when a single charge clearly covers a fixed multi-month term paid upfront, e.g. "6-month plan" → 6, "annual"/"1-year"/"yearly" → 12, "quarterly"/"3 months" → 3, "biannual"/"2 years" → 24.
- This lets us show the monthly-equivalent cost. OMIT termMonths for ordinary one-off purchases and normal monthly charges.` }],
